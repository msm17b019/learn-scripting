# Variable Naming Conventions

In Bash scripting, the following are the variable naming conventions:

- Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore (_).
- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- Variable names should not contain spaces or special characters.
- Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable.
- Avoid using reserved keywords, such as if, then, else, fi, and so on as variable names.
