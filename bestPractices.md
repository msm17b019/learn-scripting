# Best Practices

- Give your script a name that makes sense.

- Leave out .sh extension for executables.

- Variable names must be in lower-case with underscores to separate words.

- Design your script to be re-usable.

- Script should not require to be edited before running.

- Use command line arguments to pass inputs.

- Always start with a Shebang in your scripts.

- Always return appropriate exit codes in your script.

- Always develop scripts in a modular re-usable way using functions.

- Avoid duplicate code.

- Use arguments/parameters to pass in variables.

- Comments are very helpful in documenting the code, and it is a good practice to add them to help others understand the code.
